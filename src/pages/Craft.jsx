            <p>
                We live in an age of relatively unlimited access to information. With the internet a few moves of a mouse or taps on a glass screen/keyboard you can get more information about "anything"<br />
                There is a freedom and power that comes with this access.<br />
                This makes it easy to slip into mindless consumption,<br />
                A lot of the time this feels like drinking from a fire hose, the thirst which was there at the beginning of the scrolling is never satisfied<br />
                The individual chooses if and when they want to consume it
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl">curation</h3>
            <p>
                With the power in the individuals hands, you get to be the one who chooses where to direct your attention<br />
                this is where curation comes in <br />
                it's about being intentional with the media chosen to consume<br />
                finding what you care about and going deeper into that<br />
                find the source<br />
                understanding how it has evolved over time <br />
                document what you find, make a collage(block of marble)
